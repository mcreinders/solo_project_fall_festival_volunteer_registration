# solo_project_fall_festival_volunteer_registration

General Description
This project is designed to utilize the technical and project management skills learned throughout the course of study completed to date at Prime Digital Academy.  The web application being built will facilitate volunteer registration for the annual St. Bonaventure Fall Festival.  I have volunteered at this festival for over ten years and the system to sign up volunteers has always used paper sign up slips that are filled out by the person volunteering.  One copy of the form is kept by the volunteer, one copy goes in a file and one copy is physically affixed to a sign up board that is hung in the church.  The copy on file is mailed out to the volunteer as a reminder.  This application will allow volunteers to sign in and select from available volunteer openings eliminating the paper sign up slips.  It will allow the fall festival coordinator the ability to view a volunteer report that highlights unfilled shifts and give them the ability to access this data at any time. 
Deployment Plan

This project will be created using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node).  
The following technologies will be used:

Front end:
This application will use AngularJS (version 1.4.9) for $http calls and DOM manipulation.
Design will be accomplished with Boostrap, CSS3 and HTML5.

Server:
This application will run on Node.js (version 5.3.0) server utilizing Express (version 4.13.4).

Database:
Username, password and volunteer registration information will be stored on a MongoDB database (version 3.2.0).  Passwords will be verified utilizing Passport (version 0.3.2) and will be encrypted utilizing Bcrypt file encryption (version 0.8.5).  
Git will be used for version control.
